To start server
php -S localhost:8888 

Variable
$this = variable

This is a $this;

You have to use double quotes if you have a variable in there
single quote will show you whats in there with $

conditionals
if else
<?= ?>
same as
<?php echo ?>

<?php
		$name = "Dark Matter";
		$read = true;

		if ("$read") {
			$message = "You have read $name";
		} else {
			$message = "You have not read $name";

		}
	?>

		<?= $message ?>
	<br>
	<?= "Hello World"; ?>


	Arrays

	<h1>Good Books</h1>

<?php 

	$books = [
		"Dangus",
		"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep",
		"The Langoliers",
	];
?>

<ul>
	<?php foreach ($books as $book) : ?>
		<li><?= $book ?></li>
	<?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>


If in an array and you only want one specific item

$books [1] or $books [2]


Associative Arrays
allows you to reference one part of an array
You put an array in an array

$books = [
	[
		'name' => 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep',
		'author' => 'Philip K. Dick', 
		'purchaseUrl' => 'google.com',
		'releaseYear' => '1999'
	],

	[
		'name' => 'Project Hail Mary',
		'author' => 'Andy Weir',
		'purchaseUrl' => 'google.com',
		'releaseYear' => '1989'
	],
];

?>

	<ul>
		<?php foreach ($books as $book) : ?>

		<li>
			<a href="<?= $book['purchaseUrl'] ?>">
			<?= $book['name']; ?> (<?= $book ['releaseYear']; ?>)
			</a>	

		</li>

		<?php endforeach; ?>
	</ul>


	Functions and Filters
	Functions are verbs of programming. be called, do something and then return results

	nice way to include complex code in a neat function

	Single = when you want to assign a value. 
	Triple === when you want to check quality

	<?php foreach ($books as $book) : ?>
			<?php if ($book['author'] === 'Andy Weir') : ?>

		<li>
			<a href="<?= $book['purchaseUrl'] ?>">
			<?= $book['name']; ?> (<?= $book ['releaseYear']; ?>) By <?= $book['author'] ?>
			</a>	

		</li>
			<?php endif; ?>
		<?php endforeach; ?>

		function filterByAuthor() {
			return 
		}

		filterByAuthor(); 	// calls function // 



		function filterByAuthor($books) {
	$filteredBooks = [];   // this is a new array creating

	// here it is receiving all of the info in $books //

	foreach ($books as $book) {   // loop through books we gave it
		if ($book['author'] === 'Andy Weir') {    // check the author of each item in array
			$filteredBooks[] = $book; // then add the book to a new array
		}
	}

<ul>
		<?php foreach (filterByAuthor($books) as $book) : ?>  // call the function here in loop. 
			

		<li>
			<a href="<?= $book['purchaseUrl'] ?>">
				<?= $book['name']; ?> (<?= $book ['releaseYear']; ?>) By <?= $book['author'] ?>
			</a>	

		</li>
			
		<?php endforeach; ?>
	</ul>


	Lambda Functions ////

	You can have anonymous function. You can assign it to variable or pass it to other functions



	// Connect to our MYSQL database


$dsn = "mysql:host=localhost;port=3306;dbname=myapp;charset=utf8mb4";
$pdo = new PDO($dsn, 'root');
$statement = $pdo->prepare("select * from posts where id = 1");
$statement->execute();

$posts = $statement->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

// dd($posts);

foreach ($posts as $post) {
	echo "<li>" . $post['title'] . "</li>";
}

// echo "<li>" . $post['title'] . "</li>";



Methods are verbs of prgram world 
Class - follow the nouns

Connect to database and execute query

class Database {
public function query()
	{

	}
}

$db = new Database();

$db->query();

never inline user data into a query string
